This is a repository of my game "Tank Striker"

Do not try to do pull requests, I wont check them. I created this repository just to publish the code of my game.

If you want to update code for yourself, use these tools:

C++ 23+
SFML 2.5.1
MSVC Compiler(If sou use GCC/CLang, then change .dll lib files for your complier)

И помните: Слава C++, Python'исты тоже гуманитарии!
